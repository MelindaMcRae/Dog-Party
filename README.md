# Dog Party

Dog Party is a project designed for those new to front end coding to learn HTML and CSS. This project is very useful for learning the foundation of HTML and CSS, and how everything works and fits together. There is a chance to go further and add a different comp with the same HTML, in order to learn how to make your HTML code flexible for multiple layouts. There is also an step beyond that in going further to build user interaction with JavaScript. I did not expand upon the original project, therefore what is shown is the static page with HTML and CSS that I used to recreate the Dog Party comp page as accurately as possible.

*Below is the comp page provided that I had to recreate:*

# The Process

I focused on HTML and CSS in this project. My approach to making this successful was to keep the HTMl as simple and semantic as possible, and giving everything a container and classes within the container.  The containers were helpful in sectioning off areas of the page, and the classes allowed me to target all the different elements of the page. This makes the page easier to manipulate, and also to apply multiple layouts to the HTML code. In my CSS, I worked in order the the page is laid out, from top to bottom, containers and then contents in the containers. I tried to keep it as simply as I could, and made sure nothing conflicted or cancelled out each other.
